# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Cause of Increasing Temperature
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Investigate how demographic variables, such as rural and urban population sizes, correlate with CO2 emissions and temperature increases. This analysis could highlight the role of population dynamics in driving agricultural emissions and their impact on climate change.?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project examines how rural and urban population sizes correlate with CO2 emissions and temperature changes in agriculture. By analyzing demographic and environmental datasets, it seeks to uncover how population dynamics influence agricultural emissions and subsequent climate impacts.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: ExampleSource-1
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml
* Data Type: CSV

### Datasource1: ExampleSource-2 
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitrakumari25/smart-agricultural-production-optimizing-engine
* Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chitrakumari25/smart-agricultural-production-optimizing-engine
* Data Type: CSV

I'm utilizing two Kaggle datasets related to agriculture and CO2 emissions. The smart agriculture dataset is chosen because as population grows, it affects every sector of agriculture. Traditional production techniques significantly contribute to CO2 emissions.
